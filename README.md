# NyraOS
Pretty. Pure. Powerful.

Well, here it is folks! Nyra OS, version 1, for the public!
I never thought I'd ever get around to sharing it with others, 
but I guess I stand corrected. Please feel free to edit and
do whatever you want with it! Just mention the original creator,
me!

Will require Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player, at the least.
Also will need a version of Windows above 7, as far as I know!
I programmed this on Windows 10, so feel free to tell me the compatibility
list so I can improve!

Love,
Jessica P. Fawkes
