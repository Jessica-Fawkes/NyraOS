# NyraOS
Pretty. Pure. Powerful.

Will require Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player at the least.

Nyra OS is a batch-based simple OS, coded to rival others (if there are any), and pass them. Originally, it was created and updated under the name "CMD OS.x", then was dropped during 2017. Finally, it was retired in 2018, which created the dawn of Nyra OS, first produced in 2019.

Nyra OS is designed to be pure, using no other add ons or extensions. It is designed to be pretty, with a basic UI reminiscent of CMD OS.x, with a user-friendly approach, and simplistic design. It is designed to be powerful, using small code to achieve big things. With each update, I pledge to help improve the user experience, add features, and ensure the happiness of whomever downloads this.

Will require Windows 7+, Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player at the least.

Love,
Jessica P. Fawkes
